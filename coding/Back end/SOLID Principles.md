## **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:  
 - `class should have only one reason to change`, meaning it should only have one responsibility. 
## **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:  
Software entities like classes and functions should be `open for extension but closed for modification.`
so you can use oop concipts like:
- **Inheritance**
- **Abstraction**
- **Polymorphism**
## **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:  
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This ensures derived classes extend base classes without changing their behavior.
    
## **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:  
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use . 

- in repostory pattern if entity don't need delete so you make i two Interface one wih delete one wihout delete
    
## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:  
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling and makes the system more flexible.
